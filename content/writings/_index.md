title: "Writings"

I mainly write on [Medium](https://pandeyparul.medium.com/) and maintain a healthy blog there. However, in the past I have also written for a number of other publications like KD Nuggets, Datacamp, Anaconda Built-in among others. I also wrote a piece on [Shap values](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/explain-your-machine-learning-model-predictions-with-gpu-accelerated-shap/?ncid=so-link-828764-vt27&=&linkId=100000153561822#entry-content-comments) for NVIDIA AI.

Some of my articles have also been featured in the documentation of some open-source Python libraries like [Lux](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/reference/gallery.html#community-contributions), [Modin](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/examples.html#community-contributions), [Google's What-if Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/learn/), and [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret?tab=readme-ov-file#external-links) from Microsoft.
