Hi, I'm Parul. I combine data science and developer advocacy to make machine learning accessible, responsible, and useful for real teams and communities. I've worked at H2O.ai (Principal Data Scientist) and Weights & Biases (Machine Learning Engineer). I co-authored an O'Reilly book titled Machine Learning for High-Risk Applications and regularly contribute to open-source projects and technical writing. I speak at conferences, mentor community programs, and write regularly. For recent project work and hackathon demos, check out the [Hackathons](/hackathons/) page.


### Kaggle Grandmaster | Notebooks

I achieved the title of [Kaggle Grandmaster](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey) in 2020, becoming the first woman in India and the second globally to earn this distinction in the Notebooks category. My passion lies in explaining concepts and exploring datasets, making the Notebooks category a natural fit for me. At my peak, **I ranked 7th in this category worldwide**. Additionally, my team secured 6th place in the WIDS Datathon.

Notably, my notebook titled [Geek Girls Rising: Myth or Reality!](https://www.kaggle.com/code/parulpandey/geek-girls-rising-myth-or-reality) won a prize in Kaggle's 2019 ML and DS Survey. My active engagement on Kaggle has led me to speak at various Kaggle Days Meetups and mentor participants in the 2021 Kaggle BIPOC Grant program.

### Judge for Mozilla's Responsible Computing Challenge (RCC) in India

I was one of nine experts selected to judge the Responsible Computing Challenge (RCC) in India. The challenge aimed to equip technologists with a deep understanding of how technology and society intersect. As a judge, I helped select universities that integrated ethics into their curriculum to ensure graduates prioritize critical thinking, address inequality in technology, and build equitable systems.

### Area Chair for the Ethics Section of Kaggle's AI Report 2023

I served as an Area Chair for the Ethics section of Kaggle's AI Report 2023, where I evaluated essays on ethical principles and risk mitigation strategies in machine learning applications.

### Recent Achievement

🏆 Recently I won 2nd place in the [**Meta Kaggle Hackathon**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/meta-kaggle-hackathon/writeups/why-do-so-many-kaggle-users-go-quiet-and-what-migh) for an analysis of Kaggle's community growth, identifying key signals driving engagement and retention.
