    <h3>Meta Kaggle Hackathon — 2nd place</h3>
    <p>I tried to look at the data from Kaggle's perspective — i.e., what signals matter most for community growth, and more importantly, whether Kaggle's recent efforts are helping revive the community.</p>
    <p>I believe this kind of activity can be crucial for any community as it helps in understanding what keeps people coming back, contributing, and feeling connected.</p>

    <h3>Gemma 3n Hackathon - ASHA-G</h3>
    <p>ASHA-G is an offline, privacy-first app that digitizes paper health forms for ASHA workers. Workers snap a photo of a form, the app detects fields and accepts Hindi voice input which is transcribed into Devanagari in real time, and the completed form is exported as a structured CSV for secure storage and integration with health systems.</p>
