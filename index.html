                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Parul. I bring together data science expertise and developer advocacy to bridge the gap between technology and its users.<br>
                        Previously, I have worked at <strong>H2O.ai</strong> as a Principal Data Scientist and at <strong>Weights & Biases</strong> as a Machine Learning Engineer.<br>
                        I am particularly passionate about Machine Learning for High-Risk Applications, where the stakes are significant and the need for accuracy and ethical considerations is paramount. This led me to co-author a book in this domain: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1098102436?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&_encoding=UTF8&tag=oreilly20-20" target="_blank"><strong>"Practical Machine Learning for High-Risk Applications"</strong></a>.<br>
                        I am also deeply involved in open source and developer communities, which helps me stay connected and contribute meaningfully.<br>
                        I am a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups, and I also write extensively on my <a href="https://medium.com/@pandeyparul" target="_blank"><strong>blog</strong></a>.<br>
                        I‚Äôm also a <strong>Google Developer Expert for Kaggle</strong> and a <strong>LinkedIn Top Voice</strong> (<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/parulpandeyindia" target="_blank">see profile</a>).

                    <div class="highlight-linkedin">
                        <strong>Over 100,000 followers</strong>; Currently a <strong>Top Voice</strong> and was a part of LinkedIn's <strong>Creator Accelerator Program (2023)</strong>.<br>

                            üèÜ Recently I won 2nd place in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/meta-kaggle-hackathon/writeups/why-do-so-many-kaggle-users-go-quiet-and-what-migh" target="_blank"><strong>Meta Kaggle Hackathon</strong></a> for an analysis of Kaggle‚Äôs community growth, identifying key signals driving engagement and retention.

                <h5>Kaggle Grandmaster | Notebooks</h5>
                <p>I achieved the title of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey">Kaggle Grandmaster</a> in 2020, becoming the first woman in India and the second globally to earn this distinction in the Notebooks category. My passion lies in explaining concepts and exploring datasets, making the Notebooks category a natural fit for me. At my peak, <strong>I ranked 7th in this category worldwide</strong>. Additionally, my team secured 6th place in the WIDS Datathon.</p>

                <p>Notably, my notebook titled <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/parulpandey/geek-girls-rising-myth-or-reality">Geek Girls Rising: Myth or Reality!</a> won a prize in Kaggle‚Äôs 2019 ML and DS Survey. My active engagement on Kaggle has led me to speak at various Kaggle Days Meetups and mentor participants in the 2021 Kaggle BIPOC Grant program.</p>

                <h5>Judge for Mozilla's Responsible Computing Challenge (RCC) in India</h5>
                <p>I was one of nine experts selected to judge the Responsible Computing Challenge (RCC) in India. 
                    The challenge aimed to equip technologists with a deep understanding of how technology and society intersect. 
                    As a judge, I helped select universities that integrated ethics into their curriculum to ensure graduates prioritize critical thinking, 
                    address inequality in technology, and build equitable systems.</p>
