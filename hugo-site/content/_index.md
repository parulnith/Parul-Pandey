Hi, I'm Parul. I combine data science and developer advocacy to make machine learning accessible, responsible, and useful for real teams and communities. I've worked at H2O.ai (Principal Data Scientist) and Weights & Biases (Machine Learning Engineer). I co-authored an O'Reilly book titled Machine Learning for High-Risk Applications and regularly contribute to open-source projects and technical writing. I speak at conferences, mentor community programs, and write regularly.
